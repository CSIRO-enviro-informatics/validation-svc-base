This package contains skeleton framework for a two pass XML validation service - first pass XSD validation 
and second pass Schematron validation. 

Typically, users will need to extend the validation classes for their specific implementations. 
e.g. WaterML2.0 validation.

Run ant jar to obtain the jar file to use in your implementation.
